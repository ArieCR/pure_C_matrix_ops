This library implements some simple methods for matrix operation in C such aas: matrix addition, matrix multiplication, matrix inversion and etc.
Also included are some python scripts to generate tests for this library in the python library. 
A test library is also implemented, specifically for mulitplication and inversion. You can test it yourself by doing the following steps:
1. generating tests using the python scripts provided
2. compiling the program using "make test" 
3. evaluate the output of the implemented function in C in comparision to the expected output from common python libraries (implemented in my script using existing numpy methods)
